## Proposal Title :

Vegetable Oil and Obesity

## Questions, Methods, Data and Justification Discussion

In current global health news, and a new popular discussion on social media, vegtable oil is being speculated to be one of the root causes of obesity in the US. Some have even made bold claims that it might be the leading cause over any other possible factors correlated to obesity. There has historically been a harsh stereotype placed on Americans which is that most of them are obese due to consuming the typical American diet, lack of physical activity, and many other variables. It is also factual to point out that obesity is relevant on an international level instead of just in the US. While there are many scientific and statistical studies conducted proving many of these variables to be directly correlated with obesity, there is not a definite answer to what the number-one overall cause to the the high obesity rates in the US is. When analyzing these variables, it is often not recognized that the high obesity rates could be a systematic historical and anthropological issue instead of personal decisions made by a high percentage of Americans. This leads to looking at questions such as: what foods have been historically popularized, who or what companies have popularized these foods, how has the media contributed to this food consumption, how has the media contributed to influencing culture into habits leading to obesity, are some citizens being more affected than others, or how does the US compare to other countries? Some of these questions are currently being explored with the recent focus on studying the correlation of vegetable oil to obesity. Data analysts and scientists are investigating what foods vegetable oil is used the most in, how much vegetable oil is used per year, how vegetable oil affects making food in terms of ingredients, how different countries use vegetable oil in relation to each other, and many other factors. In conversation with these recent studies, our group wants to investigate: What are international cultural differences in food consumption, How may opressed or discriminated people be affected by specific food consumption, and How does the food industry contribute to the high obesity rates? To investigate these questions, we could use datasets found on: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or the World Health Organization.

*Research Questions:*
- What are the cultural differences in food consumption between different countries?
- How does the consumption of vegetable oil differ between countries?
- How do food consumption habits affect specific groups of people, particularly those who have been historically oppressed or discriminated against?
- How does the food industry contribute to the high obesity rates in the US and internationally?

*Methods:*

- Conduct a literature review to gather existing research on the relationship between vegetable oil and obesity, as well as cultural differences in food consumption and the role of the food industry in contributing to obesity rates.
- Collect data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization on vegetable oil consumption and obesity rates in different countries.
- Analyze the data using statistical methods to identify correlations between vegetable oil consumption and obesity rates, as well as differences in consumption patterns between countries.
- Conduct qualitative research, such as interviews or focus groups, with individuals from marginalized or historically oppressed communities to gather insights on how food consumption habits affect them.

*Data:*

- Vegetable oil consumption data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
- Obesity rates data from the World Health Organization.
- Qualitative data from interviews or focus groups with individuals from marginalized or historically oppressed communities.
- 
*Justification and Discussion:*

The relationship between vegetable oil and obesity is a relevant and timely topic, given the ongoing discussion around healthy eating habits and the high obesity rates in the US and internationally. By studying the cultural differences in food consumption and the role of the food industry in contributing to obesity rates, we can gain a better understanding of the systemic issues that contribute to this problem. Additionally, by focusing on the experiences of marginalized or historically oppressed communities, we can bring attention to the ways in which food consumption habits can affect different groups of people differently. Our research could potentially inform policy decisions and public health initiatives aimed at reducing obesity rates and promoting healthy eating habits.
